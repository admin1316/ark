# AGENTS.md

DeepSeek Harness is a plugin-based agent harness on vendored Cordis. Read [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) before changing `packages/`; follow [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md) for documentation.

## Pre-release stance: foundation over blast radius

Remove this section at the first tagged release. Before then, prefer correct foundations to compatibility shims: rename or repackage freely and update every reference. Backends reject old on-disk formats; SQLite `SCHEMA_VERSION` is monotonic and `dsh-session` keeps `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` at `0` with no compatibility promise.

## Ark.app native product invariant

- `/Applications/Ark.app` is Ark's only visible product, built with AppKit/SwiftUI. Never expose WKWebView, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PWA, or browser routes; loopback is an authenticated API-only sidecar.
- Preserve Ark's visual, functional, and interaction baseline. Until parity is verified, retain native equivalents for Settings, sidebar, Chat, scroll following, Trajectory, archive management, Workbench, and knowledge views.
- UI acceptance requires an isolated candidate, native interaction tests, and same-state screenshots against the legacy source; builds and unit tests alone do not qualify.
- Never mutate the active runtime or user profile in place. Validate a candidate, retain rollback outside `/Applications`, then atomically replace `/Applications/Ark.app` only after it passes.
- Release and Git publication are separate: prepare a dry-run change and push plan, then wait for explicit user confirmation before pushing or rewriting remote history.

Package groups: [packages/README.md](packages/README.md).

## Commands

```sh
pnpm install            # pnpm workspaces, node ^22.19 || >=24
pnpm run clean           # remove build outputs and safe residue from deleted packages
pnpm run test           # vitest unit tests
pnpm run test:coverage  # CI coverage gate: per-file 100% on packages/*/*/src
pnpm run test:e2e       # real-API tests; self-skip without DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
pnpm run test:snapshot  # keyless ACP/headless replay vs expected outputs; filter: -t <name>
pnpm run test:snapshot:record  # re-record expected outputs (needs key)
pnpm run typecheck
pnpm run lint
pnpm run duplication    # cross-file TypeScript clone detection
pnpm run build          # tsc emits lib/types, tsdown bundles runtime
pnpm run hygiene        # knip + publint + workspace constraints + NodeNext consumer check
pnpm run check:windows-wine  # ONLY when diagnosing a known Windows failure (needs wine); CI owns this signal
pnpm run doc-sync       # all documentation gates; leaf list in scripts/run-gates.ts
pnpm run website:build  # VitePress build (doubles as dead-link check)
pnpm dsh --profile headless "task"  # run one task from source (needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
pnpm run demo:cordis    # the agent modifies its own runtime (needs key)
pnpm run demo:acp       # ACP automation server (needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY)
```

### Host sandbox failures

When required `gh`, `pnpm`, build, test, or generator commands fail because the agent sandbox blocks credentials, network, IPC, file watching, or nested `sandbox-exec`, retry unchanged with the narrowest host escalation before diagnosing authentication or project failure. Require sandbox evidence; never bypass genuine test failures or the product sandbox under test.

### Run relevant checks locally

Use [dsh-pre-push-checks](.agents/skills/dsh-pre-push-checks/SKILL.md) before pushes and report only commands run. After `gh stack sync`, validate immediately; do not merge before checks pass.

- Match evidence to the surface: focused behavior tests, snapshots for model/user output, `doc-sync` for docs, built smokes for published paths, and real-API e2e for providers.
- Do not default to the full suite or repeat passing checks. CI owns exhaustive coverage and the platform matrix; run all locally only by explicit request, CI diagnosis, or an irreducibly repository-wide change.
- `test:coverage`, not `test`, is the CI coverage gate ([why](docs/testing.md)).

## Secrets / .env

Real-API tests and demos read `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, optional `DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL`, and root `.env`. cordis.yml allows `!!js` (never `!js`) under plugin `config` and entry `disabled`; other metadata stays literal, so conditional composition also uses overlays ([primer](docs/cordis-primer.md#loader-configuration)). Never commit credentials. CI e2e skips without a key; [testing.md](docs/testing.md) owns key policy.

## Conventions

- Packages are private `@deepseek-ai/dsh-<name>` workspaces; vendored packages are rescoped and `@deepseek-ai/cordis` is a peer + dev dependency ([mapping](docs/rescope.md)).
- ESM everywhere: use package names across packages and `.ts` locally. Config subprocesses use built `lib/`; source regressions use their declared launchers. The `dsh` source launch is ESM-only through `tsx`; raw/Web `cordis.yml` plugins must be resolver-manifest dependencies ([source-launch](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-07-29-dsh-source-launch-tsx-esm.md)).
- **Registrations are effects**: every contribution goes through `ctx.effect()` / `ctx.on()`; a registry's `register()` returns the disposer.
- **Runtime invariants assert owned relationships.** Check authoritative event streams or mutable data, not service or method presence, plugin metadata or effects, or fixed pure examples. Without a plausible relationship, an explained empty companion is correct ([package invariant rules](packages/AGENTS.md)).
- **Typed events use declaration merging** and merge-extensible maps. Event JSDoc needs `@mode` and payload `@param`; scoped keys absent from payloads need `@dshScopeScan unsupported`. Unknown `SessionEventMap` members reject logs unless the envelope is `ignorable`; only structural changes bump `SESSION_FORMAT_VERSION` ([mechanism](.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-08-10-session-log-version-mechanism.md)).
- **Switch on discriminant tags.** Closed unions end in `assertNever`; merge-extensible unions fall through a documented default.
- **Waterfall listeners MUST call `next()`** to delegate; returning without it short-circuits the chain ([semantics](docs/cordis-primer.md#cordis-waterfall-semantics)).
- **Model-visible ⟺ logged**: anything that reaches a model request must be reconstructable from the session log; a new model-visible input requires a session event.
- **Plugins, not loop changes**: new behavior goes on documented extension points; changing `agent-loop` requires updating docs/architecture.md.
- **A capability seam comprises Service Definition / Service Provider / Consumer roles.** It is complete, never one role; split only when roles evolve independently ([glossary](docs/glossary.md#capability-seam)).
- **Prefer maintained dependencies over hand-rolling** when they genuinely delete owned code and tests ([policy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-07-26-dependencies-over-hand-rolling.md)).
- **Explicit > implicit at package boundaries**: defaulting is an explicit `resolve(request): Spec` step in the owning implementation, never a hidden `?? default` inside `run()` (the `dsh-shell` request/spec split is the template).
- **No hardcoded tunables in plugins**: deployment-varying choices are validated `Config` fields changeable from cordis.yml; a `DEFAULT_*` constant or test hook is not configurability. Protocol constants, external specs, and security invariants stay fixed.
- **Misconfiguration fails loud** at load when self-contained, otherwise at the earliest resolvable point; never silently skip a missing referent.
- **Opaque cross-boundary ids are branded** (`Branded<B>` from `dsh-brand`), never bare `string`.
- **Trust TypeScript at typed same-process boundaries.** Validate at parser/config, queued, model/tool JSON, durable/file, worker, process, and wire boundaries; do not add redundant fallback or hostile-input checks.
- **Source plane vs artifact plane, never mixed.** Static gates and tests resolve workspace imports through tsconfig `paths` to `src` and pass on a clean tree; gates consuming built `lib/` declare that dependency ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **Keep compiler faces explicit.** Each package uses one aggregate except `api/remotes`; repo-wide programs seed a face config, never the root solution ([layout](docs/development.md#typescript-project-layout)).
- **An empty `catch` names what it swallows** and why nothing else can reach it; keep the `try` to one statement.
- Do not comment on facts obvious from code.
- **Prefer symmetry for parallel values**; unexplained asymmetry usually signals a missed extraction.
- **Tests describe behavior, not correctness.** Change obsolete behavior with its tests; explain why in the PR.
- **Non-trivial changes MUST include an Agent Note in the same PR;** only mechanical/local edits are exempt ([scope](.agents/notes/README.md#when-to-write-one)). Archived notes are frozen: never edit or treat them as current authority ([archive policy](.agents/notes/README.md#archiving-and-deletion)).
- **Testing policy** — [docs/testing.md](docs/testing.md). Every non-trivial model- or product-visible change updates a keyless snapshot from a real runnable example; package, e2e-only, and mock-only tests do not replace the assembled transcript. Fixtures replay on macOS/Linux; fix fixtures, not normalizers.
- **A tool's UI render intent is part of its design**, decided up front (`generic`/`terminal`/`diff`, `locations`); presentation methods are pure functions of `args` ([cookbook](docs/cookbook/adding-a-tool.md)).
- **Plan unit, e2e, and snapshot coverage** for capability seams, lifecycle paths, and transcript output; include missing snapshot-harness support in the same change.
- **Both SDKs project the loop.** Agent-loop, session-lifecycle, and `SessionEventMap` changes update the TypeScript and Python SDK expected outputs in the same PR; `pnpm run test` covers neither ([surfaces](docs/testing.md#when-a-snapshot-test-is-required)).
- **Choose PR history deliberately.** Split independent changes and fix the introducing PR before propagation. Rewrites use `--force-with-lease`, abort on remote movement, never raw `--force`; preserve an in-progress merge-forward checkpoint before a newer base ([rationale](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-02-native-github-stacks-and-optional-rebases.md)).
- **Labels:** one PR `kind/*`, all material `area/*`, and native Issue Type ([taxonomy](.agents/notes/implemented/process/2026-08-08-unified-github-label-taxonomy.md)).
- TODO markers: `FIXME`/`TODO`/`XXX` by urgency ([semantics](docs/development.md)).
- Files end with exactly one trailing newline; `git diff --cached --check` (pre-commit) gates it.

## Defensive patterns

Read [docs/defensive-patterns.md](docs/defensive-patterns.md) before lifecycle, concurrency, subprocess, or teardown work.

## Type safety and documentation

Use `strict: true` with `noImplicitAny`; each remaining `any` explains why narrowing is infeasible. Concise JSDoc covers non-obvious module/export behavior; function-like exports include `@param`/`@returns`, as enforced by `verify-export-jsdoc`.

Comments and docs state behavior, failure, timing, ownership, and safe use, not code restatements or reasoning transcripts. Use exact terms, link rationale, put mechanically checkable invariants in executed top-level gates, and use narrow justified exceptions. [dsh-prose-standard](.agents/skills/dsh-prose-standard/SKILL.md) owns editorial detail.

Update affected README and JSDoc with code. Routine bilingual work follows [docs/AGENTS.md](docs/AGENTS.md); only explicit user invocation may run `dsh-translate-docs`.

## Editing these instructions

`CLAUDE.md` symlinks `AGENTS.md` at root, `packages/`, and `examples/`; edit the real file. Keep each rule self-contained while linking high-level docs. Condense when clarity survives; raise a `verify-doc-budgets` ceiling when the required content genuinely needs more space.

## Vendoring policy

`vendor/` packages are pinned source copies (manifest with upstream SHAs in [vendor/README.md](vendor/README.md)). Update via the sync procedure there; re-apply or retire the logged local modifications; rerun `pnpm run test && pnpm run build`.
