/**
 * Generic pi-ai-backed LLM adapter plugin. One plugin instance owns a dict of
 * provider routes; a route naming an installed pi-ai provider inherits that
 * provider's endpoint, protocol, and model catalog as defaults, and a route
 * pi-ai does not ship is declared outright. Profile facts resolve per request
 * over the optional `llm-pi-ai` user-settings section and the optional
 * credential seam, so a changed key, endpoint, model, or knob reaches the next
 * request without a restart; a changed *route set* (or a route's
 * registration-captured retry policy) re-registers the same adapter instance
 * in place.
 *
