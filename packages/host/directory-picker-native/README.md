# @deepseek-ai/dsh-host-directory-picker-native

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

The **native-OS-chooser backend** of the [directory-picker seam](../directory-picker/README.md): `NativeDirectoryPicker` registers `ctx.directoryPicker` with the `native` capability, whose `pick(signal)` opens one native chooser per call and resolves the chosen absolute path (`null` on cancel). Platform tools run without a shell: `osascript` on macOS and Zenity with a KDialog fallback on Linux; the caller's abort terminates the native process. Windows opens the modern `IFileOpenDialog` in a spawned child process — a koffi-driven COM conversation on the child's main thread with the best thread DPI awareness the host accepts (per-monitor-v2 first), aborted by posting `WM_CLOSE` to the dialog thread. The command boundary (`DirectoryPickerRunner`) and platform facts are injectable. The shared no-shell subprocess runner lives in [`dsh-native-command`](../../util/native-command/README.md).

Ark uses this Host-only backend directly from its native shell; no browser half or Client flow is shipped.

## Model Experience

None, as the backend serves the GUI host's directory selection; nothing here reaches a model request.

#### KV Cache effect

None; this package neither assembles nor sends a provider request.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

- **Linux requires desktop tooling** — with neither Zenity nor KDialog installed, `pick` rejects with an actionable error; it does not fall back to a typed-path prompt.
- **Windows has no mechanism fallback** — the child-process picker through packaged koffi is the only native tier, so a COM refusal or dialog crash surfaces the failure.
